Make a function called computerPlay()
	Make one variable called $random-number
	Make an array (“rock”, “paper”, scissors”) called $play
	Make a random number between 0 and 2, store it in variable $random-number.
	Return $play($random-number)


Make a playRound function()
	Make one variable called $computerSelection = computerPlay()
	Make a variable called $playerSelection
	Make an input thing to collect the player’s letters and pass them to the variable $playerSelection.
	Make $playerSelection lower case

	if $playerSelection and $computerSelection
	are the same return “That’s a tie!”

	if $playerSelection is “rock” then

		if $computerSelection is “scissors” return “You win! Rock beats scissors” 
		otherwise return “You lose! Paper beats rock!”.

	otherwise if $playerSelection is “paper” then

		if $computerSelection is “scissors” return “You lose! Scissors beat paper!” 
		otherwise return “You win! Paper beats rock!”.

	otherwise if $playerSelection is “scissors” then

		if $computerSelection is “paper” return “You win! Scissors beat paper!” 
		otherwise return “You lose! Rock beats scissors!”

	otherwise return FALSE


Make a function called game()
	Game has an object called scores. 
	scores.wins is 0
	scores.losses is 0
	Make a loop to do the following thing 5 times 
	Run playRound () and store its result in a variable called $result 
	If $result is win then increase scores. wins by 1
	If $result is lose then increases scores.losses by 1
	Run the loop to the end
	If scores.wins > than scores.losses then return string “Game over! You won!” 
	If scores.losses>than scores.wins then return string “Game over! You lose!” 
	If scores.wins =  scores.losses then return string “Game over! That’s a tie!”
